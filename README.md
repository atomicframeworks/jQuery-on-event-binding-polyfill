jQuery-on-event-binding-polyfill
=================================

jQuery .on() method support for older (pre v1.7) versions of jQuery.

Monkeypatches jQuery with a new jQuery.fn.on method if it is not already present.

Include a tag for this script just after your jquery tag to provide .on() event binding syntax in older versions of jQuery.
